# Virtual Lawyer

Welcome to the **Virtual Lawyer** project! This is a personal learning initiative focused on exploring how AI tools can assist with legal research and document analysis. The project is built around two main components: `lang_chain` and `scrapper`.

---

## What is `lang_chain`?

In this project, `lang_chain` refers to a custom implementation of the popular framework designed for building applications powered by large language models (LLMs). This implementation is tailored to process Turkish legal data, handle legal queries, and generate insightful responses. It also manages workflows and coordinates the interaction between the `scrapper` and other components of the system.

## What is `scrapper`?

The `scrapper` is a custom tool developed to gather data from Turkish legal resources, particularly from [mevzuat.gov.tr](https://www.mevzuat.gov.tr). It collects valuable legal information, such as case laws, statutes, and articles, which are then processed by the `lang_chain` component to provide useful insights.

## Project Goals

- **Automated Legal Research**: Use AI to help find relevant Turkish legal information.
- **Document Analysis**: Analyze Turkish legal documents and provide summaries or insights.
- **Learning Opportunity**: Improve understanding of AI frameworks and web scraping techniques.

---

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: The `scrapper` gathers legal data from [mevzuat.gov.tr](https://www.mevzuat.gov.tr) and other Turkish legal sources.
2. **Processing**: The collected data is analyzed using `lang_chain` to generate insights in Turkish.
3. **Output**: The system delivers responses to legal questions or summaries of legal documents in Turkish.

## Future Improvements

- Broaden the range of Turkish legal resources covered.
- Enhance the accuracy of responses in Turkish.
- Support more advanced Turkish legal queries.

This project is still under development and serves as a way to explore the possibilities of AI in the Turkish legal field. Thank you for your interest!
